# NL-Cube User Guide

This guide will help you get started with NL-Cube, from installation to running complex natural language queries against your data.

## Installation

### Download Binary

Download the latest binary for your platform:

```bash
# Example for Linux
curl -L https://github.com/joefrost01/nl-cube/releases/latest/download/nl-cube-linux-x86_64 -o nl-cube
chmod +x nl-cube
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file in the same directory as the binary:

```toml
data_dir = "data"

[database]
connection_string = "nl-cube.db"
pool_size = 5

[web]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 3000
static_dir = "static"

[llm]
backend = "ollama"
model = "sqlcoder"
api_url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
```

### Requirements

- **Ollama** (if using local models): Follow [installation instructions](https://ollama.ai/download)
- **SQLCoder model**: `ollama pull sqlcoder` (or another SQL-focused model)

## Getting Started

### Running NL-Cube

Launch NL-Cube with your configuration:

```bash
./nl-cube --config config.toml
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Creating Your First Database

1. Click on the "Databases" dropdown in the navigation bar
2. Select "New Database"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "sales")
4. Click "Create"

### Uploading Data Files

1. Select your database from the dropdown
2. Click "Upload" in the database panel
3. Select CSV or Parquet files containing your data
4. Click "Upload"

The files will be ingested and made available as tables in your database.

### Your First Natural Language Query

1. Enter a question in the "Ask Question" box, such as:
    - "What are the top 5 products by revenue?"
    - "Show me monthly sales for 2024"
    - "Compare average order value by region"
2. Click "Run Query" or press Ctrl+Enter
3. View the results in the visualization panel

## Key Features

### Natural Language Querying

The core feature of NL-Cube is the ability to query your data using natural language. Here are some example questions you can ask:

**Simple Aggregations:**
- "What's the total revenue across all orders?"
- "How many customers do we have in each region?"

**Time-Based Analysis:**
- "Show me the trend of orders by month in 2024"
- "What was our revenue growth rate quarter over quarter?"

**Complex Analytics:**
- "What's the return rate by product category?"
- "Show me products where sales have declined for 3 consecutive months"

**Comparative Analysis:**
- "Compare performance across regions"
- "Which salespeople are performing above average?"

### Data Visualization

NL-Cube uses the FINOS Perspective library to provide interactive data visualizations:

1. **Change Visualization Type:**
    - Click on the visualization dropdown to select different views:
    - Datagrid (default)
    - Various chart types (bar, line, scatter, etc.)

2. **Interactive Pivoting:**
    - Drag and drop columns to rows, columns, and values areas
    - Dynamically rearrange your data view

3. **Filtering and Sorting:**
    - Click column headers to sort
    - Use the filter icon to apply filters

4. **Export Options:**
    - Export to CSV
    - Copy data to clipboard
    - Save current view

### Working with Multiple Databases

NL-Cube allows you to organize your data into separate databases (subjects):

1. **Creating Databases:**
    - Use the "New Database" option to create logical domains
    - Example domains: "Sales", "Marketing", "HR", "Finance"

2. **Switching Between Databases:**
    - Select the database from the dropdown
    - Tables will update to show data from that database

3. **Database Isolation:**
    - Each database has its own file storage
    - Queries run against the currently selected database

## Advanced Usage

### Saving Reports (Todo)

After executing a query that produces valuable insights:

1. Click on "Reports" in the navigation bar
2. Select "Save Report"
3. Enter a name, category, and optional description
4. Click "Save"

Saved reports can be accessed from the Reports dropdown for future reference.

### Query History

NL-Cube keeps track of your recent queries:

1. Click on "History" in the navigation bar to see recent queries
2. Click on any query to run it again
3. Use the "Clear" button to reset your history

### SQL Preview

For users who want to see the SQL behind the natural language:

1. Toggle the "Show SQL" switch
2. The generated SQL will appear below your question
3. This is helpful for learning and debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No data appears after upload:**

   * Check file format (should be valid CSV or Parquet)
   * Verify file has headers and valid data 
   * Check browser console for any error messages

**Query returns unexpected results:**

- Try rephrasing your question to be more specific
- Toggle SQL preview to see how your question was interpreted
- Examine the SQL to identify potential misinterpretations
- Make sure that you refer to column names, the LLM won't necessarily figure out that customer means cust_id - larger LLMs will handle this better

**Performance issues with large datasets:**

- Consider splitting very large files into smaller chunks
- Add specific filters to your natural language query
- Limit the time range in your query when possible

### Instructions:
Your task is to convert a question into a SQL query, given a Postgres database schema.
Adhere to these rules:
- **Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word** to appropriately answer the question
- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float

### Input:
Generate a SQL query that answers the question `What's the total revenue (unit_price × quantity) across all orders placed in 2025`.
This query will run on a database whose schema is represented in this string:
CREATE TABLE orders (
                        order_id UUID,
                        customer_id UUID,
                        order_date DATE,
                        product_category STRING,
                        product_id STRING,
                        region STRING,
                        quantity INTEGER,
                        unit_price DOUBLE,
                        discount DOUBLE,
                        delivery_date DATE,
                        courier_name STRING
);

CREATE TABLE returns (
                         return_id UUID,
                         order_id UUID,
                         return_date DATE,
                         return_reason STRING,
                         refund_amount DOUBLE
);
